# BeeHappy: Mental Health Tracker

An andoid based mental health tracker application developed using Flutter and Firebase.

The project focuses on building a mental health tracker. The application will try to get an idea of the mental state of the user, find out if they are suffering and then suggest measures they can take to get out of their present condition. A user answers some questions and based on the answers that they provide, it will suggest tasks to
them. The UI of the application is built using Flutter and Dart. Keeping in mind that the user must be suffering already, the interface of the application is kept as friendly as possible. The project provides authentication to the users that is done using Firebase authentication at the backend. The app provides options to login with Google, Facebook, Email ID or login anonymously as well. 

Below snapshots show how the application looks like!
